### User Stories

### Wireframes

### Code Snippet Highlight


##### This snippet was particularily challenging for me to get working properly. The create function requires an object parameter with the key value pairs I had specified in my PostgreSql query in my model. 


##### Passing in any other parameter will not match the SQL table template, and will result in an error. This is also the case when updating an existing entry from the database.

### Features in Progress
##### This project was intended to implement Spotify's Web Api to fetch artists, albumns, tracks, and other metadata where users can connect their account, search Spotify's database, create and share playlists. In addition, user authentication will be added to allow users to log in and access a user-specific section.
